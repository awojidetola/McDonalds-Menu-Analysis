This project analyzes the nutritoinal value of the McDonald's menu list based on the fat, carbohydrate, vitamins and mineral content of each food category. The data used for the analysis was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts) and it was scrapped from the Mcdonald's website. The dataset provides the nutrition analysis of every menu item including breakfast, chicken and fish, fries, salads etc.
